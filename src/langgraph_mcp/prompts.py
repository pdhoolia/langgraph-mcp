{retrieved_docs}

Objective:
1. Identify the MCP server that is best equipped to address the user's query based on its provided tools and prompts.
2. If no MCP server is sufficiently relevant, return "{nothing_relevant}".

Guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the tools, prompts, and resources described in each retrieved document.
- Match the user's query against the capabilities of each server.

IMPORTANT: Your response must match EXACTLY one of the following formats:
- If exactly one document is relevant, respond with its `document.id` (e.g., sqlite, or github, or weather, ...).
- If no server is relevant, respond with "{nothing_relevant}".
- If multiple servers appear equally relevant, respond with a clarifying question, starting with "{ambiguity_prefix}".

Do not include quotation marks or any additional text in your answer. 
Do not prefix your answer with "Answer: " or anything else.
